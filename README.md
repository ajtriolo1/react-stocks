# React Stocks App

This is a project meant to emulate a stock trading website. The app allows you to create an account and then "trade" and keep track of whatever stocks you would like.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the website is hosted on Heroku and can be found [here](http://stocks.thetriolos.com). The demo may take a little while to load since Heroku goes to sleep after 30 minutes of no one visting the site.
